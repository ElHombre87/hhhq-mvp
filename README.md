# Mantine and xstate playground project

## Introduction

this is a silly demo project with modular elements built primarily on next.js, mantine ui, xstate
and some storybook development setup.

## Installation

```bash
yarn install
```

## Usage

To launch the project in dev mode, run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

For storybook
  
```bash
yarn storybook
```

I'll be adding other components and such to test new stuff and integration.
This project has no actual functionality.
